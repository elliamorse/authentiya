# Authentiya Code Documentation Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the documentation standards for the Authentiya codebase. All developers contributing to this project should follow these guidelines to maintain consistent and comprehensive documentation.

## Documentation Requirements

### Prologue Comments

Every file should begin with a prologue comment block that includes:

1. **Name of code artifact** - File name and type
2. **Brief description** - What the code does
3. **Programmer's name** - Original author
4. **Date created** - When the file was first created
5. **Dates revised** - When the file was modified
6. **Description of revisions** - What changes were made and by whom
7. **Preconditions** - What must be true before the code runs
8. **Postconditions** - What will be true after the code runs
9. **Side effects** - Any effects beyond the main purpose
10. **Known issues** - Any known bugs or limitations

### Example Prologue:

```typescript
/**
 * File: ComponentName.tsx
 * 
 * Description: This component [brief description of what it does]
 * 
 * Programmer: [Author Name]
 * Created: [Month Year]
 * Revised: [Month Year] - [Brief description of changes]
 * 
 * Preconditions:
 *   - [Required state or props]
 *   - [Required context]
 * 
 * Postconditions:
 *   - [What the component renders or returns]
 *   - [Side effects it causes]
 * 
 * Side effects:
 *   - [Database operations]
 *   - [State changes outside the component]
 * 
 * Known issues:
 *   - [Any known bugs or limitations]
 */
```

### Function and Method Documentation

Each function or method should have:

1. Description of purpose
2. Parameters and their meanings
3. Return values and their meanings
4. Exceptions or errors that may be thrown
5. Examples of usage for complex functions

### Example Function Comment:

```typescript
/**
 * Authenticates a user with email and password
 * 
 * @param email - User's email address
 * @param password - User's password
 * @returns User session object if successful
 * @throws AuthError if credentials are invalid
 * 
 * Example:
 * ```
 * const session = await authenticateUser("user@example.com", "password123");
 * ```
 */
```

### Code Block Comments

Major blocks of code should have summary comments explaining:

1. Purpose of the block
2. How it fits into the larger process
3. Any complex logic or algorithms used

### Line Comments

Add comments for:

1. Non-obvious code
2. Workarounds or temporary solutions
3. Complex expressions
4. Business logic implementations

## Component Documentation

React components should have:

1. Interface/type definitions for props
2. Description of the component's purpose
3. How to use the component with examples
4. Description of state management
5. Side effects (useEffect explanations)

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Comments Updated**: Update comments when code changes
2. **Be Clear and Concise**: Write in plain English
3. **Explain Why, Not Just What**: Code shows what is happening; comments should explain why
4. **Document UI/UX Decisions**: Explain the reasoning behind design choices
5. **Use JSDoc Standard Syntax**: For consistency across the codebase
6. **Comment Complex Logic**: Particularly focus on business rules and edge cases

## Framework-Specific Documentation

For frameworks and libraries used (React, Supabase, etc.):

1. Explain integration points
2. Document configuration options
3. Reference official documentation where appropriate

## Maintenance

Documentation should be reviewed during code reviews with the same attention as the code itself. Out-of-date documentation should be updated or flagged.
