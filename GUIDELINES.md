# Authentiya Project Guidelines

## Project Overview

Authentiya is an academic integrity platform that helps educators monitor student writing processes and authenticate student work. The platform features:

- Real-time writing monitoring
- Copy-paste detection with citation prompts
- Progress analytics for students and teachers
- Assignment management and feedback system

## Key Documentation

The project includes several documentation files for developers:

- **KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md**: Technical details about the project architecture, data models, and component structure
- **DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md**: Coding standards, patterns, and best practices for contributors
- **PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md**: User-focused documentation explaining the application's features and use cases

## Core Architecture

Authentiya follows a component-based architecture using React, with clear separation between:

- **Student interface**: Writing environment, citation tools, and progress metrics
- **Teacher interface**: Assignment management, student monitoring, and analytics

## Design Principles

1. **Simplicity**: Focus on core features that solve real problems
2. **Feedback**: Provide immediate feedback to users about their actions
3. **Accessibility**: Ensure the platform works for all users
4. **Efficiency**: Optimize for performance and minimal workflow disruption
5. **Privacy**: Handle student data securely and transparently

## Development Standards

### Code Quality
- Keep components under 200 lines of code
- Follow TypeScript type definitions strictly
- Maintain a consistent component structure
- Write descriptive comments for complex logic

### Design System
- Use the defined color palette consistently
- Follow responsive design principles
- Maintain accessibility contrast standards
- Reuse components for interface consistency

### Performance
- Optimize rendering with memoization where needed
- Use code splitting for larger features
- Monitor and reduce bundle sizes

## Getting Started

1. Review the knowledge base to understand the project architecture
2. Familiarize yourself with the development guidelines
3. Explore the existing components to understand patterns
4. Start with small, focused changes following the established patterns

## Contribution Workflow

1. Create a focused branch for your changes
2. Follow the coding standards in the development guidelines
3. Write tests for new functionality
4. Submit a PR with screenshots for UI changes
5. Address review feedback
6. Ensure all checks pass before merging

## Upcoming Roadmap

1. **Authentication System**: Implement secure login for students and teachers
2. **Canvas Integration**: Connect with the Canvas LMS API
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Develop detailed writing pattern analysis
4. **Plagiarism Detection**: Add AI-powered content comparison
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Enhance the experience on smaller devices
