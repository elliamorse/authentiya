## About Authentiya

Authentiya is a browser extension designed to solve the challenge of maintaining academic integrity in an AI-powered world. With the rise of AI tools, schools are increasingly concerned about student learning and potential plagiarism. Authentiya provides a seamless solution that:

- Runs in the background like Grammarly
- Offers real-time tracking of AI usage
- Provides comprehensive reporting at scale
- Integrates with learning management systems

Unlike competitors such as TurnItIn (which works after submission and has accuracy issues) or GPTZero (which lacks LMS integration), Authentiya offers a vigilant and actionable solution that works alongside students and teachers.

## Project Features

- **Student Dashboard**: Track writing progress and manage assignments
- **Document Editor**: Write with real-time tracking and citation support
- **Teacher Dashboard**: Monitor student work and identify potential AI usage
- **Assignment Management**: Create, track, and evaluate student assignments
- **Contact Form**: Request pricing information and customize solutions for your institution
