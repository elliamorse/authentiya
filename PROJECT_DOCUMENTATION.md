# Authentiya Project Documentation Guidelines

This document outlines the documentation standards for the Authentiya academic integrity platform.

## Documentation Requirements

All files in the Authentiya project must include the following documentation elements:

### Prologue Comments
- **Name of code artifact**: File name and component/module name
- **Brief description**: What the code does and its purpose in the system
- **Programmer's name**: Original author
- **Date created**: When the file was first created
- **Revision history**: Dates and descriptions of significant revisions with author names
- **Preconditions**: Required states or conditions before code execution
- **Input values/types**: Acceptable and unacceptable inputs with explanations
- **Postconditions**: Expected state after code execution
- **Return values/types**: What the code returns and the meaning
- **Error/exception conditions**: Possible errors and their meanings
- **Side effects**: Any system changes outside the primary purpose
- **Invariants**: Conditions that remain true throughout execution
- **Known faults**: Any known bugs or limitations

### In-Code Documentation
- **Block comments**: Comments summarizing major blocks of code
- **Line comments**: Comments explaining complex or non-obvious lines
- **Framework documentation**: For framework-generated code, sufficient explanation for programmers familiar with but not expert in the framework
